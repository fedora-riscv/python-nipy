.SH DESCRIPTION
Runs the time series difference algorithm over a 4D image volume,
often an FMRI volume.
.P
It works in one of three modes:
.RS +7n
.IP \(bu 2
.I interactive\fR\ :
the time series difference plot appears on screen.
This is the default mode
.IP \(bu 2
.I non-interactive, plot only\fR\ :
write time series difference plot to graphic file.
Use the
.RB \(lq \-\-out\-file= < \fImyfilename >\(rq
option to activate this mode
.IP \(bu 2
.I non-interactive, write plot, images and variables\fR\ :
write plot to file,
and write generated diagnostic images and variables to files as well.
Use the
.RB \(lq \-\-write\-results \(rq
flag to activate this option.
The generated filenames come from the results of the
.RB \(lq \-\-write\-results \(rq
.RB \(lq \-\-out\-path \(rq
and
.RB \(lq \-\-out\-fname\-label \(rq
options (see
.BR OPTIONS ).

.SS "WRITE-RESULTS OPTION, GENERATED FILES"
When doing the time point analysis,
we will make a difference volume
between each time point and the next time point in the series.
If we have
.I T
volumes then there will be
.RI ( T \-1)
difference volumes.
Call the vector of difference volumes
.I DV
and the first difference volume
.IR DV [0].
So
.I DV [0]
results from subtraction of the second volume in the 4D input image
from the first volume in the 4D input image.
The element-wise squared values from
.IR DV [0]
is
.IR DV2 [0].
.P
The following images will be generated.
.RI < ext >
is the input filename extension (e.g. \(oq\fB.nii\fR\(cq):
.RS +7n
.IP \(bu 2
.RB \(lq dv2_max_ < \fIlabel >< \fIext >\(rq\ :
3D image volume,
where each slice
.I S
is slice from all of
.I DV2 [0]
(slice
.IR S )
through
.IR DV2 [ T \-1]
(slice
.IR S )
that has the maximum summed squared values.
This volume gives an idea of the worst (highest difference) slices
across the whole time series.
.IP \(bu 2
.RB \(lq dv2_mean_ < \fIlabel >< \fIext >\(rq\ :
the mean of all
.I DV2
volumes
.IR DV2 [0]\ ..\  DV [ T \-1]
across the volume (time) dimension.
Higher voxel values in this volume
mean that time-point to time point differences
tended to be high in this voxel.
.RE
.P
We also write the mean signal at each time point,
and the mean squared difference between each slice in time,
as variables to a
.RB \(oq npz \(cq
file named
.RB \(lq tsdiff_ < \fIlabel > .npz \(rq
.P
The filenames for the outputs are of the form
.RI < out\-path > \fB/ < some_prefix >< label >< file\-ext >
where
.RI < out\-path >
is the path specified by the
.B \-\-out\-path
option, or the path of the input filename;
.RI < some_prefix >
is one of the standard prefixes above,
.RI < label >
is given by
.BR \-\-out\-label ,
or by the filename of the input image
(with path and extension removed),
and
.RI < file\-ext >
is
.RB \(oq .png \(cq
for graphics, or the extension of the input filename for volume images.
For example, specifying only the input filename
.B /some/path/fname.img
will generate filenames of the form
.BR /some/path/tsdiff_fname.png ,
.B /some/path/dv2_max_fname.img
etc.
